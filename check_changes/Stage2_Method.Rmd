# Methods

## Hypotheses and Design

Both the sentence-picture verification task and the picture-picture verification task involve  a between-participant and a within-participant independent variable. The between-participant variable is the 18 languages registered in this study. The within-participant variable is the match or mismatch in object orientation. This binary factor, in the sentence-picture verification task, reflects the matching between the sentence and the picture, whereas in the picture-picture verification, it reflects the orientation settings between two pictures. The only dependent variable for both tasks is the response time. 
In the sentence-picture verification task, we expect response time to be shorter for matching compared to mismatching orientations. We expect to see the match advantage within each language. We did not select languages systematically, but instead based on who our collaborators could recruit. We did not have any specific hypotheses about the relative size of the object orientation match advantage in different languages. In the picture-picture verification task, we expect shorter response time for identical orientation compared to different orientations. We computed an imagery score by subtracting the verification time for identical orientation from the verification time for different orientations. Based on the assumption that the mental rotation is a general cognitive aspect, we expect imagery scores to be the same on average across languages, and can be used to predict a possible match advantage [see @chenDoesObjectSize2020]. 


## Participant

Through the collaboration of The Psychological Science Accelerator [@moshontzPsychologicalScienceAccelerator2018], we collected data in 18 languages. Our priori power analysis recommended a language would have at least one thousand participants based on the current design[^1]. Only English data approached this number because 17 laboratories recruited native English speakers. Based on the preregistered plan, the available participants’ accuracy had to reach 70%. Before the pandemic outbreak, `r format(sum(insite_meta$N), scientific=FALSE, big.mark = ",")` participants (`r format(sum(insite_meta$Female_N), scientific=FALSE, big.mark = ",")` women; *M* = `r format(round(mean(insite_meta$Age),2), scientific=FALSE, big.mark = ",")` years old) from `r length(insite_meta$PSA_ID)` laboratories joined and finished the study. After the study migrated online, there were `r sum(osweb_meta$N)` participants (`r sum(osweb_meta$Female_N)` women; *M* = `r round(mean(osweb_meta$Age,na.rm=TRUE),2)` years old) from `r format(sum(osweb_meta$N), scientific=FALSE, big.mark = ",")` laboratories completed the study. Web-based participants at the beginning heard the auditory instruction and had to correctly answer at least 2 of 3 comprehension check questions about the instructions. All participating laboratories had ethical approval before data collection. Appendix 1 summarizes the average characteristics by language and laboratory.

## General Procedure and Materials

Participating laboratories conducted the tasks as follows. In the beginning of the sentence-picture verification task, participants had to correctly answer all the practice trials as the instruction. <!---(see \autoref{fig:procedure} for an outline of the general procedure). The sentence-picture verification task will start before or after the survey of @phillsGenderedSocialCategoryinpreparation.---> Each trial started with a left-justified and horizontally centered fixation point displayed for 1000 ms, immediately followed by the probe sentence. The sentence was presented until the participant pressed the space key, acknowledging that they understood the sentence. Then, the object picture was presented in the center of the screen until the participant responded otherwise it disappeared after 2 seconds. Participants were instructed to verify the object picture mentioned in the probe sentence as quickly and accurately as they could. Following the original study [@stanfield_effect_2001], a memory check test was carried out after every three to eight trials to ensure that the participants had read each sentence carefully. 

The picture-picture verification task used the same object pictures. In each trial, two objects appeared on either side of the central fixation point until either the participant indicated that the pictures displayed the same object or two different objects or until 2 seconds elapsed. Two pictures showing the same critical object appeared in each “yes” trial; two pictures showing two different objects from the filler items appeared in each “no” trial. 


All the procedures are compiled in OpenSesame scripts [@mathotOpenSesameOpensourceGraphical2012].  Before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, `r sum(!(insite_meta$PSA_ID %in% osweb_meta$Batch))-1` participating laboratories had completed data collection. The remaining laboratories had to stop data collection because of local lockdowns. The project team decided to move data collection online. To minimize the differences between on-site and web-based studies , we converted the original Python code to Javascript and collected the data through a JATOS server [@langeJustAnotherTool2015]. After the changes in the procedure were approved by the journal editor and reviewers, we proceeded with the online study from February to June 2021. For the remote version, a recorded set of verbal instructions was played at first. Participants had to confirm they were native speakers of the targeted language. All verbal briefings were packaged in the language-specific scripts. Appendix 2 describes the deployment of the scripts and the results of participants’ fluency tests. Following the literature, we did not anticipate any theoretically important differences between the two data sources [see @anwyl-irvineGorillaOurMidst2020; @bridgesTimingMegastudyComparing2020a; @deleeuwPsychophysicsWebBrowser2016]. The instructions and experimental scripts are available at the public OSF folder (https://osf.io/e428p/ "Materials" in Files). 

## Analysis plan

**Confirmatory Analysis** According to our preregistered analysis plan[^2], this study used meta-analysis and mixed-effect models to estimate the match advantage across languages. The meta-analysis summarized the median reaction times by match condition to determine the global effect size. This approach was compatible with ANOVA used by the original study [@stanfield_effect_2001]. The mixed-effect models involved the actual response time and analysed the fixed effects using mixed-effects models [@baayen_mixed-effects_2008]. This approach was used by recent studies [@chenDoesObjectSize2020; @kosterMentalSimulationObject2018]. Without the systematic comparison of pros and cons between the two approaches, the current analysis employed two approaches to estimate the match advantage. 
The statistical analyses were conducted by R packages  including *metafor* for meta analysis [@viechtbauerConductingMetaAnalysesMetafor2010], *lme4* [@batesFittingLinearMixedEffects2015] and *lmerTest* [@kuznetsovaLmerTestPackageTests2017] for mixed-effects models, as well as multiple regression through R base package (Version 4.1.1; R Core Team, 2021). 

Imagery scores are the dependent measure of the picture-picture verification responses. Tidied response times were summarized by the difference between the identical and different orientation. According to our preregistered analysis plan [^3], we first evaluated the equality of imagery scores across languages in use of the mixed-effects models. Our other linear regression analysis evaluated the imagery scores as the predictor of match advantage. In a best fit model having the imagery score as the predictor, the slope would indicate its accountability.

**Exploratory Analysis** In one of the cases below we conducted the mixed-effect models for some language dataset. At first the total sample size reached recommended sample size as our prior power analysis. Otherwise the meta-analysis indicated a language dataset showed a significant match advantage. Although this analysis was not in the preregistered analysis plan, the authors contributed to the methodology agreed this analysis could improve the reliability of the linguistic-specific result.  

**Decision criterion** P values were interpreted using the preregistered alpha level of .05. Because in our preregistered plan each language was assumed a standalone group, P values  of the analysis by each language were not corrected [@armstrongWhenUseBonferroni2014]. All the final mixed-effects models were selected by pursuing a maximal random-effects structure whilst allowing the model to converge [@batesFittingLinearMixedEffects2015]. P values for each effect were calculated using the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom [@lukeEvaluatingSignificanceLinear2017].
