# Introduction

Mental simulation of object properties is a major topic in conceptual processing research [@ostarekSixChallengesEmbodiment2019a; @scorolli2014embodiment]. Theoretical frameworks of conceptual processing demonstrate the integration of linguistic representations and situated simulation [e.g., @barsalou_grounded_2008; @zwaan_embodiment_2014]. Proponents of situated cognition assume that perceptual representations are able to be generated during language processing. Recently, some neuroimaging studies are testing this hypothesis on the cortical activation patterns from seeing visual images and reading text [see the summary of @ostarekSixChallengesEmbodiment2019a, p. 596].

One empirical index of situated simulation is the mental simulation effects measured in sentence-picture verification (see Figure \@ref(fig:fig01) ). This task requires participants to read a probe sentence displayed on the screen. On the following screen, the participants see a picture of an object and must verify whether the object was mentioned in the probe sentence. Response times to the pictures are summarized as the mental simulation effects, which occurs when people are faster to verify pictured objects whose properties match those of objects implied in the probe sentences. Mental simulation effects have been demonstrated for object shape [@zwaanLanguageComprehendersMentally2002], color [@connellRepresentingObjectColour2007], and orientation [@stanfield_effect_2001]. Subsequent replication studies revealed consistent results for the shape but inconsistent findings for the color and orientation effects [@koning_mental_2017; @rommersObjectShapeOrientation2013; @zwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012], and the theoretical frameworks do not provide researchers much guidance regarding the potential causes for this discrepancy. With the accumulating concerns about the lack of reproducibility, researchers have found it challenging to update the theoretical framework in terms of mental simulation effects being unreplicable [e.g., @kaschakEmbodimentLabTheory2021]. Researchers who intended to improve the theoretical framework necessarily require a reproducible protocol for measuring the mental simulation effects.

An additional facet of this research is the linguistic representations of object properties may play a role in the unreliability of the mental simulation effect. Mental simulation effects for object shape have consistently appeared in English [@zwaanEmbodiedSentenceComprehension2005; @zwaanParticipantNonnaiveteReproducibility2017; @zwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012], Chinese [@liERPStudyMental2017], Dutch [@engelenPerceptualSimulationDeveloping2011; @koning_mental_2017; @pecherLanguageComprehendersRetain2009; @rommersObjectShapeOrientation2013], German [@kosterMentalSimulationObject2018], Croatian [@seticNumericalCongruencyEffect2017], and Japanese [@satoOneWordTime2013]. Object orientation, on the other hand, has produced mixed results across languages [@chenDoesObjectSize2020; @koning_mental_2017; @kosterMentalSimulationObject2018; @zwaanEmbodiedSentenceComprehension2005; @zwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012]. Among the studies of shape and orientation, the results indicated smaller effect sizes of object orientation than that of object shape (e.g., d = 0.10 vs. 0.17; in Zwaan and Pecher, 2012; 0.07 vs. 0.27 in de Koning et al., 2017). To understand the causes for the discrepancies among object properties and languages, it is imperative to consider the cross-linguistic and experimental factors of the sentence-picture verification task<!---[^1]--->.

## Cross-linguistic, Methodological, and Cognitive Factors 

Several factors might contribute to cross-linguistic differences in the match advantage of orientation, and we focused on context, methodological, and cognitive factors. Researchers have argued that languages differ in how they encode motion and placement events in sentences [@newmanCrosslinguisticOverviewPosture2002; @verkerkEvolutionaryDynamicsMotion2014]. In addition, the potential role of mental rotation as a confound has been considered [@rommersObjectShapeOrientation2013]. We expand on how the context, experimental, and cognitive factors hinder the improvement of theoretical frameworks as below. 

**Context Factors.** The probe sentences used in object orientation studies usually contain several motion events (e.g., “The ant walked towards the pot of honey and tried to climb in.”). The languages we probed in this study encode motion events in different ways, and grammatical differences between them could explain the different match advantage results. According to @verkerkEvolutionaryDynamicsMotion2014, Germanic languages (e.g., Dutch, English, German) generally encode the manner of motion in the verb (e.g., ‘The ant dashed’), while conveying the path information through satellite adjuncts (e.g., ‘towards the pot of honey’). In contrast, other languages, such as the Romance family (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish) more often encode path in the verb (e.g., ‘crossing,’ ‘exiting’). Crucially, the past research on the match advantage of object orientation is exclusively based on Germanic languages, and yet, there were differences across those languages, with English being the only one that consistently yielded the match advantage. As a minor difference across Germanic languages in this regard, Verkerk notes that path-only constructions (e.g., ‘The ant went to the feast’) are more common in English than in other Germanic languages. 

Another topic to be considered is the lexical encoding of placement in each language, as the stimuli contains several placement events (e.g., ‘Sara situated the expensive plate on its holder on the shelf.’). @chenDoesObjectSize2020 and @kosterMentalSimulationObject2018 noted that some Germanic languages, such as German and Dutch, often make the orientation of objects more explicit than English. Whereas in English readers could use the verb “put” in both “She put the book on the table” and “She put the bottle on the table,” in both Dutch and German, readers could instead say “She laid the book on the table,” and “She stood the bottle on the table.” In these literal translations from German and Dutch, the verb “lay” encodes a horizontal orientation, whereas the verb “stand” encodes a vertical orientation. This distinction extends to verbs indicating existence. As @newmanCrosslinguisticOverviewPosture2002 exemplified, an English speaker would be likely to say “There’s a lamp in the corner,” whereas a Dutch speaker would be more likely to say “There ‘stands’ a lamp in the corner.” Nonetheless, we cannot conclude that these cross-linguistic differences are affecting the match advantage across languages because the current theories [e.g.,  language and situated simulation, @barsalou_grounded_2008] do not  precisely define the complexity of linguistic aspects such as placement events. 

**Methodological  factors.** Inconsistent findings on the match advantage of object orientation generated the debates about the reliable task design, such as in the studies failing to detect the match advantage participants not being required to verify the probe sentences they had read [see @zwaan_embodiment_2014]. Without such a verification, participants might have paid less attention to the meaning of the probe sentences, in which they would have been less likely to form a mental representation of the objects [e.g., @zwaanReadersConstructSpatial1993]. In this regard, it is relevant to acknowledge that variability originating from individual differences and other characteristics of experiments can substantially influence the results [@barsalouEstablishingGeneralizableMechanisms2019; @kaschakEmbodimentLabTheory2021].


**Cognitive Factors.** Since the first study showed a match advantage of object orientation [@stanfield_effect_2001], later studies on this topic have examined the association between the match advantage and alternative cognitive mechanisms rather than the situated simulation. Spatial cognition is one of the potential cognitive mechanisms, which may be measured with mental rotation tasks. Studies have suggested that mental rotation tasks offer valid reflections of previous spatial experience [@frickMentalObjectRotation2013] and of current spatial cognition [@chuSpontaneousGesturesMental2008; @pouwMoreEmbeddedExtended2014]. @koning_mental_2017 suggested that effectiveness of mental rotation could increase with the object size then facilitate the processing to replace the mismatched orientation described in the sentence. @chenDoesObjectSize2020 examined this implication in use of the picture-picture verification task that was designed using the mental rotation paradigm [@cohenMentalRotationMental1993]. In each trial of this task, two pictures appear on opposite sides of the screen. Participants had to verify whether the pictures represent identical or different objects. This study not only indicated the shorter verification times for the same orientation (i.e., two identical pictures presented in horizontal or vertical orientation) but also showed the larger time difference for the large size object (i.e., pictures are bridges versus pictures are pens). The results patterns are consistent among their investigated languages: English, Dutch, and Chinese. In comparison with the results of sentence-picture verification and picture-picture verification, -@chenDoesObjectSize2020 revealed the plausible hypothesis that mental rotation may affect the comprehension in some languages whereas in others. This study converted the picture-picture verification times to the mental rotation scores that were the discrepancy of verification times between the identical and different orientation[^1]. With this measurement, we explore the relation of mental rotation in spatial cognition and orientation effect in comprehension across the investigated languages.


[^1]: In the preregistered plan, we used the term "imagery score" but many collaborators hardly realized what the measurement refers to. Therefore, we used "mental rotation scores" instead of "imagery scores" in the final report. 


## Purposes of this study

To scrutinize the discrepancies of object orientation effects across languages and cognitive factors, we examined the reproducibility of this effect. In this multi-lab collaboration, our preregistered plan aimed at detecting a general match advantage of object orientation across languages and evaluated the magnitude of match advantage in each specific language. Additionally, we examined if match advantages were related to the mental rotation index. Thus, this study followed the original methods from @stanfield_effect_2001 and addressed two primary questions: (1) How much of the match advantage of object orientation can be obtained within different languages and (2) How do differences in the mental rotation index affect the match advantage across languages?
