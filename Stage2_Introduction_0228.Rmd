# Introduction

The simulation of object properties is a major topic in conceptual processing research [@ostarekSixChallengesEmbodiment2019a; @scorolli2014embodiment]. One well-known method for assessing mental simulation during sentence reading is the sentence-picture verification task. The task requires participants to read a probe sentence displayed on the screen. On the following screen, the participants see a picture of an object and must verify whether the object was mentioned in the probe sentence. For example, the probe sentence, ’Tom hammered the nail into the wall’ might be followed by a picture of a nail. 
Of central interest in the sentence-picture verification task is the match advantage, which occurs when people are faster to verify pictured objects whose properties match those of objects mentioned in the probe sentences. For example, in the sentence involving nails hammered into walls, an object orientation match advantage occurs when people are faster to verify horizontal nails than vertical ones. First discovered by @stanfield_effect_2001, object orientation match advantages suggest that people mentally simulate objects during semantic processing [e.g., @barsalouPerceptualSymbolSystems1999; @barsalouSimulationSituatedConceptualization2009].
Researchers have found match advantages for shape [@zwaanLanguageComprehendersMentally2002] and color [@zwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012; but see @connellRepresentingObjectColour2007]. Consistent effects have appeared in English [@zwaanEmbodiedSentenceComprehension2005; @zwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012], Chinese [@liERPStudyMental2017], Dutch [@koning_mental_2017; @engelenPerceptualSimulationDeveloping2011; @pecherLanguageComprehendersRetain2009; @rommersObjectShapeOrientation2013], German [@kosterMentalSimulationObject2018], Croatian [@seticNumericalCongruencyEffect2017], and Japanese [@satoOneWordTime2013]. Object orientation, on the other hand, has produced mixed results across languages [@chenDoesObjectSize2020; @koning_mental_2017; @kosterMentalSimulationObject2018; @zwaanEmbodiedSentenceComprehension2005; @zwaanRevisitingMentalSimulation2012]. To scrutinize the discrepancies across languages, we tested the match advantage of object orientation across 18 languages by means of a multi-lab collaboration.
Among object properties, shape and color are described as intrinsic, which mean that these properties are relatively independent from the observer’s state. That is, regardless of the observers’ location or state, the object keeps its intrinsic properties constant. In contrast, an extrinsic property such as object orientation is dependent on the observer’s state. Studies on visual simulation have suggested that match advantages for intrinsic properties are more consistent than those for extrinsic properties [@kosterMentalSimulationObject2018; @koning_mental_2017]. On the other hand,  studies on motor simulation [ @glenbergGroundingLanguageAction2002; @beilockSportsExperienceChanges2008] showed the sentences that imply extrinsic properties (e.g., Joe sends the card to you) facilitated the responses to a congruent target (e.g., a “card” presented in a larger size). A later study suggests that orientation match advantages are stronger for large objects [@chenDoesObjectSize2020]. Taken together, these results suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic properties produce match advantages, though the advantage may be smaller for extrinsic properties.

## Cross-linguistic and Experimental Factors

Several factors might contribute to cross-linguistic differences in the match advantage of orientation, including cultural, lexical and experimental ones. First, @ghandhariDifferentKindsEmbodied2020 found that cultural differences between Persian and Italian participants influenced the action sentence compatibility effect [for further differences studied in psycholinguistics, see @norcliffeCrosslinguisticPsycholinguisticsIts2015]. Second, languages differ in how they encode motion and placement events in sentences. Last, the potential role of mental rotation as a confound has been considered. We expand on the lexical and experimental factors below.

**Lexical Factors.** The probe sentences used in object orientation studies usually contain several motion events (e.g., “The ant walked towards the pot of honey and tried to climb in.”). The languages we probed in this study encode motion events in different ways, and grammatical differences between them could explain the different match advantage results. According to @verkerkEvolutionaryDynamicsMotion2014, Germanic languages (e.g., Dutch, English, German) generally encode the manner of motion in the verb (e.g., ‘The ant dashed’), while conveying the path information through satellite adjuncts (e.g., ‘towards the pot of honey’). In contrast, other languages, such as the Romance family (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish) more often encode path in the verb (e.g., ‘crossing’, ‘exiting’). Crucially, the past research on the match advantage of object orientation is exclusively based on Germanic languages, and yet, there were differences across those languages, with English being the only one that consistently yielded the match advantage. As a minor difference across Germanic languages in this regard, Verkerk notes that path-only constructions (e.g., ‘The ant went to the feast’) are more common in English than in other Germanic languages. 

Another topic to be considered is the lexical encoding of placement in each language, as the stimuli contains several placement events (e.g., ‘Sara situated the expensive plate on its holder on the shelf.’). @chenDoesObjectSize2020 and @kosterMentalSimulationObject2018 noted that some Germanic languages, such as German and Dutch, often make the orientation of objects more explicit than English. Whereas in English one could use the verb “put” in both “She put the book on the table” and “She put the bottle on the table,” in both Dutch and German, one could instead say “She laid the book on the table,” and “She stood the bottle on the table.” In these literal translations from German and Dutch, the verb “lay” encodes a horizontal orientation, whereas the verb “stand” encodes a vertical orientation. This distinction extends to verbs indicating existence. As @newmanCrosslinguisticOverviewPosture2002 exemplified, an English speaker would be likely to say “There’s a lamp in the corner,” whereas a Dutch speaker would be more likely to say “There ‘stands’ a lamp in the corner.” Nonetheless, we cannot conclude that these cross-linguistic differences are affecting the match advantage across languages because there is no previous theory allowing predictions, and because placement events are not sufficiently prevalent in the stimuli. 

**Experimental factors.** @stanfield_effect_2001 found that participants who sufficiently understood the probe sentences showed a match advantage of object orientation. Later studies on this topic have examined the association between the match advantage and cognitive abilities. Spatial cognition is one of the relevant areas, which may be measured with mental rotation tasks. Studies have suggested that mental rotation tasks offer valid reflections of previous spatial experience [@frickMentalObjectRotation2013] and of current spatial cognition [@chuSpontaneousGesturesMental2008; @pouwMoreEmbeddedExtended2014]. @koning_mental_2017 suggested that mental rotation, as an alternative process to mental simulation, could quickly erase the mismatched orientation, replacing it with the orientation that matches the one described in the sentence [@cohenMentalRotationMental1993; @yaxleySimulatingVisibilityLanguage2007]. @chenDoesObjectSize2020 investigated the relationship between the match advantage and mental rotation across three languages: English, Dutch and Chinese. They introduced the picture-picture verification task to examine how individuals process the target pictures regardless of their native language. This picture-picture verification task was designed using the mental rotation paradigm [@cohenMentalRotationMental1993]. In each trial of this task, two pictures appear on opposite sides of the screen. Participants have to verify whether the pictures represent identical or different objects. The verification times for pictures of identical objects presented in the same orientation (i.e., two identical pictures presented in horizontal or vertical orientation) were shorter than those presented in different orientations (one horizontal; one vertical). Chen et al.’s findings suggested that crosslinguistic differences in the match advantage of object orientation are not confounded by mental rotation strategies.

## Purposes of this study

Several explanations have been proposed for the inconsistent findings on the match advantage of object orientation, including the procedural details of some studies, such as participants not being required to verify the probe sentences they had read [see @zwaanReplicationsShouldBe2014]. Without such a verification, participants might have paid less attention to the meaning of the probe sentences, in which case they would have been less likely to form a mental representation of the objects [e.g., @zwaanReadersConstructSpatial1993]. In this regard, it is relevant to acknowledge that variability originating from individual differences and other characteristics of experiments can substantially influence the results [@barsalouEstablishingGeneralizableMechanisms2019].Thus, this study followed the original methods from @stanfield_effect_2001 and addressed two primary questions: (1) How much of the match advantage of object orientation can be obtained within different languages and (2) How do differences in mental rotation affect the match advantage across languages?
